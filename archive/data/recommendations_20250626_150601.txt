EKG SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================================

1. High sample rate jitter (Severity: medium)
   Target: firmware
   Suggestion: Use DMA for ADC reading, check for blocking operations

2. DC offset not centered (Severity: medium)
   Target: hardware
   Suggestion: Adjust bias voltage in analog frontend

3. ADC saturation detected (Severity: high)
   Target: hardware
   Suggestion: Reduce gain or adjust input range

4. Low signal-to-noise ratio (Severity: high)
   Target: hardware
   Suggestion: Review entire analog signal path
