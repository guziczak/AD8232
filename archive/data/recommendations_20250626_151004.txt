EKG SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================================

1. High sample rate jitter (Severity: medium)
   Target: firmware
   Suggestion: Use DMA for ADC reading, check for blocking operations

2. High noise level (Severity: high)
   Target: hardware
   Suggestions:
     - Add better power supply filtering
     - Improve PCB layout and grounding
     - Add shielding to analog section

3. Strong 50Hz interference (Severity: high)
   Target: both
   Suggestions:
     - Hardware: Add notch filter or improve shielding
     - Software: Implement adaptive notch filter

4. Baseline wander (Severity: medium)
   Target: both
   Suggestions:
     - Hardware: Check electrode contact and cables
     - Software: Add high-pass filter (0.5Hz cutoff)

5. ADC saturation detected (Severity: high)
   Target: hardware
   Suggestion: Reduce gain or adjust input range

6. Low signal-to-noise ratio (Severity: high)
   Target: hardware
   Suggestion: Review entire analog signal path
